Joel Bucket was an incorrigible prankster. Everyone knew to keep an eye out for his insane tricks while interacting
 with him. Poor Miss Maloney still refused to sit down without triple checking for whoopie cushions or chewing gum
 left on her chair. Martha's hair still seemed to be a tinge green, no matter how many times she re-dyed her hair.
The statue of the mayor in the square remained headless and the statue of the dog across the street had the very
 same head super glued to its bottom. With each new victim Joel's tricks seemed to grow in absurdity and size,
 until the townsfolk decided to send him away.

But he refused to leave because he enjoyed these tricks so much. So he delibrately made a promise to the townsfolk that he would never do stupid tricks again so that he got time for his final trick in response of their decision.

He waited until very late to set up his newest trick. Under the cover of darkness no one would know what 
he was doing. He work furiously through the night for the big reveal the following morning. He could
barely contain himself.

 Joel let someone gathered all the people in town, and told them to go to the town centre. They were all gathered in the square and waiting for Joel.

Joel then pressed a button and millions of balloons appeared from everone's houses and the entire town began to float away!
