Joel Bucket was an incorrigible prankster. Everyone knew to keep an eye out for his insane tricks while interacting
 with him. Poor Miss Maloney still refused to sit down without triple checking for whoopie cushions or chewing gum
 left on her chair. Martha's hair still seemed to be a tinge green, no matter how many times she re-dyed her hair.
The statue of the mayor in the square remained headless and the statue of the dog across the street had the very
 same head super glued to its bottom. With each new victim Joel's tricks seemed to grow in absurdity and size,
 until the townsfolk decided to send him away.

But he refused to leave because he enjoyed these tricks so much. So he delibrately made a promise to the townsfolk that he would never do stupid tricks again so that he got time for his final trick in response of their decision.
